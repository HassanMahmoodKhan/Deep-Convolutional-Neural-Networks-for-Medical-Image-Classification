# Deep-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-for-Medical-Image-Classification

This project aims to employ several deep learning architectures to conduct a thorough classification analysis of brain MRI scan images and classify them to one of the two classes i.e., tumor or no-tumor. The aim is to attempt to build upon the existing architectures by leveraging concepts such as transfer learning and improve them via custom additions. Finally, a comprehensive analysis is produced for each model to weigh the advantages and disadvantages, along with potential for future use.

##Convolutional Neural Networks
CNNs are a type of neural network architecture that can uncover key information in both time series and image data. For this reason, it is highly valuable for image-related tasks, such as image recognition, object classification and pattern recognition. Compared to the other networks, a CNN delivers better performance with image inputs, and with speech or audio signal inputs. A CNN consists of at least three layers: a convolutional layer, a pooling layer and a fully connected (FC) layer.
